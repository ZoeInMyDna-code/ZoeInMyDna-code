Cloud Engineer | DevOps Enthusiast | AWS Specialist

I'm a passionate Cloud Engineer building scalable, secure infrastructure for startups like Accessivo (fintech) and EduPath.

DevOps Impact: Streamlined CI/CD with GitHub Actions, cutting deployment times and boosting reliability.

Projects That Pop:

Thought Leadership: Write engaging Medium articles on cloud engineering and DevOps best practices.

🌱 Currently Growing
Mastering Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes to orchestrate cutting-edge cloud environments.
Preparing for KCNA to level up my container orchestration skills.
